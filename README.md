### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I am a bachelor student at ETH ZÃ¼rich currently studying Math. 
I am very interested in Analysis, Differential Geometry and Linear Algebra. 
Apart from my studies, AI belongs to my hobbies, especially Text2Text and Text2Image. 
I have collaborated with fellow students to build an image translation model based on CycleGAN and partially on StyleGAN.
Furthermore, we have experimented with Text2Image generators based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
